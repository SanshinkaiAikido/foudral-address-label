Address label for aikido foudral

Use this LibreOffice document to create your own foudral address label. Using this format has the following benefits.

The front of the label gives a proper description for customs. In order to travel easily do not talk about weapons but about wooden stick as is indicated by this label.

The address is on the backside of the label so that other people or passengers will not see your personal information when travelling. You do not want everyone to see your name, postal address and telefone number.

In case you have lost your foudral, your contact information is easily accessible by the founder by removing the label from the label holden on your foudral and turning over the label.

This all might seem very trivial but plenty of misunderstandings have come forth from traveling with an aikido foudral.
